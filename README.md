# ActiveDateJs

Js doesn't have a single function to get the current time more than once, so i made a fix.

## Usage

Import ActiveDate.js into your project and call **currentTime** to get the current time + date + month + year


You can also use:

currentTime.CurrentYear

currentTime.CurrentMonth

currentTime.CurrentDay

currentTime.CurrentHour

currentTime.CurrentMinute

currentTime.CurrentSecond

To get each bit individualy
